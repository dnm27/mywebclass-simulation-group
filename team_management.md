What was learned from this experience?
Establishing a timeline can be difficult if you have not completed a project such as this one
Same goes for setting roles and tasks
We went over the individual assignments and established a set list of roles and expectations, so when we begin the next sprint we are not overwhelmed






Retrospective:

During our last team meeting, we assigned roles and discussed the project's overall architecture. As an agile team, we understood the importance of defining clear roles and responsibilities to ensure that everyone is aligned towards the project's success. We discussed the different roles and responsibilities for each team member, including the project manager, developers, quality assurance team, and product owner.

The team also had a productive discussion about the architecture of the project, where we brainstormed and collaborated on different approaches to design the system. We discussed the pros and cons of each approach and weighed the technical feasibility against the project's business requirements. This allowed us to arrive at a well-considered architecture that will serve as a solid foundation for the development work to come.

What we learned:
During the meeting, we learned the importance of clear communication and collaboration. By defining roles and responsibilities, each team member had a better understanding of their part in the project's success. This understanding led to increased ownership and accountability, which will help us to deliver a successful project.

We also learned that open communication and collaboration during the architecture discussion can lead to a more robust and effective system design. By pooling our collective expertise, we were able to identify potential issues and design an architecture that is scalable and maintainable.

Improvements for next sprint:
One improvement we can make for the next sprint is to better understand the business requirements. This will help us to better align the technical design with the project's business goals and ensure that we deliver a product that meets the project requirements.

We can also improve the meeting by setting clear expectations for the outcomes and ensuring that all participants come prepared with their ideas and inputs.

Clear plan for implementation:
To implement the improvements for the next sprint, we will improve on understanding the business requirements better. We will also ensure that we set clear expectations for the meeting and that all participants come prepared with their ideas and inputs.

Additionally, we will regularly review the roles and responsibilities to ensure that they align with the project's evolving needs. We will also continue to promote open communication and collaboration during meetings to improve the effectiveness of our discussions and decision-making.

Overall, the meeting was productive and laid a solid foundation for the project's success. By taking what we learned and implementing the improvements identified, we can continue to work effectively as a team and deliver a successful project.
